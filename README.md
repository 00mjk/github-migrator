# github-migrator
This tool migrates a GitHub repository to another.
This is especially useful to move a repository from GitHub Enterprise to github.com.

## Basic usage
```bash
export GITHUB_MIGRATOR_SOURCE_API_TOKEN=xxx
export GITHUB_MIGRATOR_SOURCE_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost/api/v3 # This might be the endpoint of GitHub Enterprise
export GITHUB_MIGRATOR_TARGET_API_TOKEN=yyy
go run . [owner]/[source] [owner]/[target]
```
