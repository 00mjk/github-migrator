# github-migrator
This tool migrates a GitHub repository to another.
This is especially useful to move a repository from GitHub Enterprise to github.com.

## Usage
```bash
export GITHUB_MIGRATOR_SOURCE_API_TOKEN=xxx
export GITHUB_MIGRATOR_SOURCE_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost/api/v3 # This might be the endpoint of GitHub Enterprise
export GITHUB_MIGRATOR_TARGET_API_TOKEN=yyy
# export GITHUB_MIGRATOR_TARGET_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.github.com # No need to specify the endpoint of github.com
go run . [old-owner]/[source] [new-owner]/[target]
```
Be sure to use this tool before pushing the git tree to the new origin (otherwise the links in the merged commits are lost).

### Other options
Sometimes same user has different user id on GitHub and Enterprise.
```bash
export GITHUB_MIGRATOR_USER_MAPPING=user-before1:user-after1,user-before2:user-after2,user-before3:user-after3
```
